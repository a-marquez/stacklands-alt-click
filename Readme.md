# Stacklands Alt Click

Stacklands Alt Click (SAC) is a mod that adds convenience features/behaviors to Stacklands.

SAC repurposes `Alt + Click` and `Shift + Alt + Click` to provide the following features:

- Grabbing only contents of containers/chests:
  - `Alt + Click` grabs one card/coins
  - `Shift + Alt + Click` tries to grab 5 cards/coins
- Convenient purchasing
  - `Alt + Click` on a pack attempts to automatically pay coins/shells from board/chests and grabs the pack

In part, SAC tries to help you keep your board organized by not grabbing cards if they don't have an **alternative** behavior associated with them. For example, alt clicking a resource chest is meant to help you grab contents, if it happens to be empty then alt click will do nothing and the card will stay put.

### Planned Features:

- `Alt + Click` on an equipment/villager card grabs all **currently visible** equipment/villagers of the same type
- `Shift + Alt + Click` on an equipment/villager card grabs all **existing** equipment/villagers of the same type
